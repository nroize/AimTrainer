# AimTrainer

This is a simple school project I did as the summative for my ICS4U (Grade 12 Computer Science) course in grade 11. It's an aim training game, meant to copy the [aim trainer on HumanBenchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/aim) but written entirely in Java, using OOP principles. I'm probably never going to update this but feel free to look around the code if you like - I got 100% on the assignment and 97% in the course overall.
